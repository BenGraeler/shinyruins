# shinyruins

This is a prototypical implementation in R and shiny of a climate scenario explorer that shall also convey the associated uncertainties. It is designed to set the climate forecasts of different scenarios into relation to current or past conditions. The data is grouped by decade to further stress the uncertainties in the simulation.  A deployment of this application can be accessed [here](https://copulatheque.shinyapps.io/shinyruins/). The data is based on publicly available climate forecasts simulations.

The [RUINS](https://www.ere.uni-freiburg.de/forschung-en/forschungsprojekte/ruins) project addresses risk and uncertainty under climate change. It includes the public and decision makers in different regions along the German North Sea coast. In order to support the communication with the public, the project  designed and implemented web applications to better assess and communicate the associated risks. 52Â°North contributes experience with and knowledge about uncertainty modelling and visualization as well as implementation of web applications. This led to our prototypical implementation, which the RUINS consortium adopted and adapted. Furthermore, we set up a web application based survey to assess the risk propensity of citizens in the study regions.
